# Time Series versus Cross Sectional Momentum
We empirically examine the differences between time-series and cross-sectional momentum
based on the stocks included in the German Prime All Share Index. Our
method is mainly based on the findings of Goyal and Jegadeesh (2017) and Kim et al.
(2016). In particular, we examine the relevance of volatility scaling and net-long positions
for comparing the two momentum strategies. With equally-sized long and short
positions, we observe cross-sectional momentum outperforming time-series momentum
for a sample period from 1996 to 2018. Net-long positions and volatility scaling
contribute both to even higher returns. However, we find that not the weighting in
volatility scaling, but the time-varying investment into risky assets causes significant
changes in returns. All in all, no unequivocal evidence for the superiority of the timeseries
momentum could be determined suggesting that abnormal returns in the study
of Moskowitz et al. (2012) were not due to the anomaly itself.
